# The Game of m,n,k

## Description and end product
I am proposing a game for this final project titled The Game of MNK, based on the abstract mathematical board game often used in many branches of game theory. Essentially, a k-in-a-row game on an m·n board can be concisely referred to as an m,n,k-game. Two players will take turns choosing a position on the m·n board and placing their symbol within the square in that position. The winner of the game will be the first player who can place k of their symbols in a row without interference either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game will allow players to choose the dimensions of the board and the length of the line required for a win. The innovative twist I will add to the game is the enabling of gravity, which players can toggle to be on or off. This allows for more complex gameplay and ensures variety and replayability within the game. Preset options will give players a sense of flexibility without needing to select customized settings, e.g., tic-tac-toe will be the 3,3,3-game and Connect Four will be the 7,6,4-game with gravity enabled.
